      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Keywurl is a small extension for Safari that adds keyword search, similar to Firefox's "Quick Search" functionality. The name is an increasingly unimaginative portmanteau of "keyword" and "URL".</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section section2">
      <h1>Installation</h1>
      <p>
        The current beta <strong>does not have an installer</strong>. Apple's installer
        tool is something I'm not going to fight with right now. So to install:
      </p>
      <p>
        Copy <b><tt>Keywurl.bundle</tt></b> into
        <b><tt>Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins</tt></b> under your home folder, <em>or</em>
        in <b><tt>/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins</tt></b> in the hard drive root if you
        want Keywurl to be enabled for all users on the computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Remember to also run the SIMBL installer</b>. If SIMBL does not work properly, try
        installing it system-wide. Or, if that was what you were doing, try installing it
        for your user account only.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section section2">
      <h1>Uninstalling</h1>
      <p>
        To uninstall, just delete the file you copied.

      <h1>Changes</h1>

      <h2><b>1.4 beta 6 </b>(June 12th, 2009)</h2>
      <p>Updated to Safari 4 final.</p>

      <h2><b>1.4 beta 5 </b>(March 16, 2009)</h2>
      <p>Fixes the <strong>default</strong> keyword to avoid using Safari's fallback 
      for names that are probably not proper domain names. Also fixed the
      preference bubbles which were accidentally broken in the last release.
      </p>
      
      <h2><b>1.4 beta 4 </b>(March 15, 2009)</h2>
      <p>Fixes several bugs, the most important
      one being in handling legitimate addresses typed without the http:// prefix;
      this restores the way address resolution worked with Safari 3, with the
      additional benefit that you can now remap hosts as keywords. For example, 
      you can create a keyword named <strong>apple.com</strong> and have it
      expand to <strong>apple.de</strong>. This release also fixes and improves
      the right-click-to-create-keyword feature, and fixes the 
      default <strong>default</strong> expansion, which was broken.
      </p>

      <h2><b>1.4 beta 3 </b>(February 25, 2009)</h2>
      <p>Support for for the new Safari 4 beta. Fixed a bug where keywords would not be
        saved if you created it with the context menu. Currently Leopard only.</p>

      <h2><b>1.4 beta 2 </b>(Mar 20, 2008)</h2>
      <p>Safari 3.1 changed some internals that broke how Keywurl handled fallbacks when no 
        "default" keyword has been created; so just typing foo in the address field would 
        not take you to www.foo.com.</p>

      <h2><b>1.4 beta 1 </b>(February 20, 2008)</h2>
      <p>First beta.</p>
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li><b class="high">You can now create a new keyword just by right-clicking on any text field in any web page form, and selecting <i>Create Keyword</i>. </b>Keywurl takes care of the dirty details.</li>
        <li><b class="high">Nicer substitution syntax.</b> The "@@@" and "$$$" expansion symbols have been replaced with a more human-friendly system that does not rely on magic syntax. Instead, the address field now shows the substitutions using nice, friendly, little blue bubble shapes. Old configuration files are automatically migrated from the old syntax. The available substitutions are shown in a separate box, and you can drag them with the mouse into the address field. Visual editing, yay!</li>
        <li><b class="high">It is now possible to address each query word separately</b>: In the query "foo bar", "query 1" expands to "foo", "query 2" to "bar", etc. Up to 10 such query terms are supported. For example, this allows you to map a queries such as: <a href="http://quote.fool.com/Chart/chart.asp?time=1dy&amp;symbols=aapl">graph 2yr aapl</a> (stock prices for Apple over two years) or <a href="http://quote.fool.com/Chart/chart.asp?time=1dy&amp;symbols=msft">graph 1dy msft</a> (stock prices for Microsoft for one day).</li>
        <li>The configuration file is now backed up to a separate file whenever it is saved.</li>
        <li>The keyword list in the preference dialog is now sorted lexicographically.</li>
        <li>Some minor bug fixes to the way selection and keyword creation is handled.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><b>1.3.3 </b>(February 18, 2008)</h2>
      <p>Safari 3.1 compatibility.</p>
      <h2><b>1.3.2 </b>(January 29, 2008)</h2>
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li><b class="high">Tiger compatibility</b>.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash when exiting the preference pane.</li>
        <li>Fixed so that Safari's default fallback (eg., going to "foo.com" when you enter just "foo") works if there is no default keyword.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><b>1.3.1 </b>(January 27, 2008)</h2>
      <p>This released was hoped to fix Tiger compatibility. It did not.</p>
      <h2><b>1.3 </b>(January 24, 2008)</h2>
      <p>This is a minor bug fix release. Thanks to Eli Dourado and Brian de Alwis for ideas and suggestions.</p>
      <h2><b>1.2 </b>(January 23, 2008)</h2>
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li><b class="high">Default keyword</b>.<b> </b>The keyword "default" (if it is defined) is now invoked when no other keyword matches. Google is included as an example. For example, typing "Paris Hilton" in the address bar will now invoke a Google search. Keywurl uses a simple heuristic to determine whether something is a legitimate host name (eg., cnn.com) or something that should be expanded: If what you entered contains only a single word consisting of alphanumeric characters and at least one dot, it's considered a host name and ignored.</li>
        <li><b class="high">Single-word expansions</b>. You can now create convenience aliases â€“ for example, if you add the keyword "sd" with the expansion "slashdot.org", you can enter just "sd" in the address bar to go there.</li>
        <li><b class="high">Added per-keyword character encoding setting</b>. Some sites (such as imdb.com and amazon.com) require Latin 1 encoding for URLs. This fixes such sites.</li>
        <li><b class="high">Added per-keyboard space encoding setting</b>. Some sites require that spaces are encoded as "+" instead of "%20". This fixes such sites.</li>
        <li><b></b>The configuration file format changes in this version, breaking backwards compatibility. If you want to be able to downgrade, make a backup first.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><b>1.1</b> (November 23, 2007)</h2>
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li>Leopard compatibility.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h1>Requirements</h1>
      <p>
        For Tiger support I recommend the 1.3 series. Unfortunately, I no longer
        have a machine with Tiger on which to test. For the current versions the following
        apply:
      </p>
      </p>
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li><b class="high">Mac OS X 10.5 ("Leopard") or later</b>.</li>
        <li><b class="high">Safari 3.0</b> or later.</li>
        <li><b class="high">SIMBL</b>, which lets Keywurl be installed into Safari. SIMBL is included in the Keywurl package, and may also be <a href="http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php">downloaded here</a>.</li>
